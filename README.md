# 8-Puzzle Solver

This is a Python program that solves the classic 8-puzzle problem using various search algorithms. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and an empty tile. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to the goal state using the minimum number of moves.

## Features

- Solve the 8-puzzle problem using the following search algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - A* Search with the selected heuristic
- Solve the 8-puzzle problem using the following heuristics:
  - Hamming distance
  - Manhattan distance
  - Manhattan distance with linear conflict
  - Permutation inversion
- Display the solution path and the number of moves required to reach the goal state.
